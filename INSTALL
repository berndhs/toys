Linux
-----

This is a Qt4 project, so you should use qmake (version 4.x, not 3.x),
like this:


qmake-qt4 eyes.pro

This should create the file "Makefile", among others.

Then you can do:

make all

and you should get this executable:

eyes

and that's it.

Windows
-------

I used Qt Creator, with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express tool chain.
Open the project file "eyes.pro" build from there.


Prerequisits
------------

You need on Linux:
Qt4.5

You need on Windows:
Qt4.5

Translations
------------

If you want to translate the messages (all 5 of them) to another
language, look at the files called "*.ts" to see what you have to
translate. Then you need the Qt lrelease utility, or Qt Linguist.
To make it load your translation files, look at the main program
in runeyes.cpp. You may also want to add your translation file
(the .qm version) to the eyes.qrc file.
